# Student-Performance-algorithm
example of data manipulation and analysis using Pandas DataFrames,Automatically runs a Logistic Regression model to predict pass/fail.
Python Script that Generate Data and Predict Student Performance..This combines data generation, manipulation, and ML workflow all in one script.
what it does:
Generates a large student dataset (500+ students).

Saves it as students_large.csv.

Explores the data with summary statistics and a correlation heatmap.

Prepares the data for ML and trains a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluates the model and visualizes prediction distribution.

Saves the trained model and predicts for a new student.
